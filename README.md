Course Descriptions
------------

Code 1 introduces software as an expressive and community-centric medium for artists, designers, and technologists. Through a technical and critical lens, students learn to write custom code using the JavaScript library p5.js and build foundational understanding of object-oriented programming throughout the semester. By engaging in project-based learning, experimentation, and play, this course is facilitated with a beginner and artist-friendly mindset. Designed for students with no prior coding experience, Code 1 offers multiple contexts and approaches for creating computational visuals and interactive experience. 

Learning Outcomes
------------

The three learning pillars for Code 1 are code, design, and critique. Students are expected to:

1. Demonstrate knowledge and application of object-oriented programming skills in p5.js.
1. Embody code as an expressive medium by learning its strengths and limitations. 
1. Become familiar with the process of planning, organizing, and maintaining code & design projects. 
1. Investigate the relationship between code, design, and critique through past examples and creating your own. 
1. Gain insights into the social impact of code; how it creates empowerments and disempowerment under different contexts.
