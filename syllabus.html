They cannot view grades until providing feedback or officially declining to do so. Course evaluations are a vital space where students can speak about the learning experience. It is an important process which provides valuable data about the successful delivery and support of a course or topic to both the faculty and administrators. Instructors rely on course rating surveys for feedback on the course and teaching methods, so they can understand what aspects of the class are most successful in teaching students, and what aspects might be improved or changed in future. Without this information, it can be difficult for an instructor to reflect upon and improve teaching methods and course design. In addition, program/department chairs and other administrators review course surveys.

      description: "<h1>Course Description</h1><p>Code 1 introduces software as an expressive and community-centric medium for artists, designers, and technologists. Through a technical and critical lens, students learn to write custom code using the JavaScript library p5.js and build foundational understanding of object-oriented programming throughout the semester. By engaging in project-based learning, experimentation, and play, this course is facilitated with a beginner and artist-friendly mindset. Designed for students with no prior coding experience, Code 1 offers multiple contexts and approaches for creating computational visuals and interactive experience. ",
      learning: "<h1>Learning Objectives</h1> <p>The three learning pillars for Code 1 are code, design, and critique. Students are expected to:</p><ul><li>Demonstrate knowledge and application of object-oriented programming skills in p5.js.</li><li>Embody code as an expressive medium by learning its strengths and limitations. </li><li>Become familiar with the process of planning, organizing, and maintaining code & design projects. </li><li>Investigate the relationship between code, design, and critique through past examples and creating your own.</li><li>Gain insights into the social impact of code; how it creates empowerments and disempowerment under different contexts. </li></ul>",
      community: "<h1>Community Agreement</h1><p class='aside'>The statement remixes the p5.js Community Statement, licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0 and the voidLab statement. We will discuss and make final suggestions to this statement on the first day of class.</p><p>Code 1 is a community of learners interested in exploring the creation of art and design with technology.</p><p>We are a community of, and in solidarity with, people from every gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, language, neuro-type, size, ability, class, religion, culture, subculture, political opinion, age, skill level, occupation, and background. This means that we will use preferred pronouns, respect self-identifications, and be mindful of special needs. </p><p>We like these hashtags: <b>#noCodeSnobs</b> (because we value community over efficiency), <b>#newKidLove</b> (because we all started somewhere), <b>#unassumeCore</b> (because we don't assume knowledge), and <b>#BlackLivesMatter</b> (because of course).</p><p>In practice:</p><ul><li>We are not code snobs. </li>  <li>We listen to each other. </li><li>We recognize that people learn in different ways, therefore we don’t judge when someone asks a question.  </li><li>We actively recognize and validate multiple types of backgrounds and perspectives.  </li><li>We work together and help each other out when it’s within our capacity. </li><li>We keep our community respectful and open. </li><li>We are mindful and kind in our interactions. </li></ul><p>A collaborative effort between the students and the faculty is needed to create a supportive learning environment. While everyone should feel free to experiment creatively and conceptually, if a class member points out that something you have said or shared with the group is offensive, avoid being defensive; instead approach the discussion as a valuable opportunity for us to grow and learn from one another. Alternatively if you feel that something said in discussion or included in a piece of work is harmful, you are encouraged to speak with one of the Code 1 faculty or the BFADT director.  </p>",
      land: "<h1>Land Acknowledgement</h1><p>We would like to acknowledge the Lenni-Lenape people who are the original inhabitants of Lenapehoking and the island of Mannahatta. The land The New School University is built upon, including all of  New York City, present-day New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania along the Delaware River watershed, western Long Island, and the Lower Hudson Valley, comprise Lenape ancestral homeland. This land was not ceded nor sold, as folklore would have us believe, to the Dutch for beads and trinkets. This land was forcibly taken through occupation by European settlers, resulting in displacement, forced migration, and genocide. In the present day there are Lenape communities throughout North America, though much of the original Lenape territory remains under settler occupation and control. </p><p>As settlers who have benefitted from the colonization of sovereign land we acknowledge our responsibility to examine and question systems of oppression that continue through to the present day and educate ourselves about the original stewards of this land. </p><p>We also want to acknowledge the Haudenosaunee ironworkers from the Six Nations of the Iroquois, mostly from the Mohawk tribe whose labor built the many iconic skyscrapers and steel bridges in New York City. As recently as 2012 about 200 of the 2,000 structural ironworkers in NYC are Mohawk. Everyday we view the city skyline of Manhattan we are reminded of their contribution.</p>",
