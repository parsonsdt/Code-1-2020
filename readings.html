        Reading and Responses
      </h1>
      <P>Professors will provide prompts in each section’s Slack channel based on the readings. To gain credit, please
        respond in the channel for that prompt by class time the following week, and add something else to someone
        else’s response in a thread. </p>
      <p>Our goal is to inspire debate and discussion around the role of code in society. We may shift the requirements
        as the semester progresses if new forms of debate prove to be more enlightening. Our Reading Responses would
        usually be a discussion in class, so we’re attempting to move that online. </P>
