Use the switch statement to create your scene-to-scene transition.</p><p>Creating a gray-boxed version of the project keeps your code organized and makes it easier to debug before you add in all the details.

In addition, please include a p5 Button, Slider, or other UI element using the <a href='https://p5js.org/reference/#group-DOM'>p5 DOM interface</a>.
